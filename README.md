Amiga Lemmings watchface for Pebble Smartwatch

It's a watchface -- with Lemmings, from the classic Amiga game. Lemmings drop in, walk around, and eventually make their way to their home. The level restarts every minute with a random lemming flow rate. There is a random chance one of the lemmings will become a blocker, diverting the flow.

Constantly animated watchfaces can put a heavy drain on the battery but it is fun to show off.
